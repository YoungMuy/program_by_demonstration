This repository contains codes that I have used for my Master's Thesis at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (2012-2014). 
My work is related to a field in Robotics called **Imitation Learning**. 
You will get a good idea about this field if you read **Robot Programming by Demonstration** by Aude Billard, Sylvian Calinon, Rudiger Dillimann, Stefan Schaal.
