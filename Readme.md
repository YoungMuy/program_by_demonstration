This repository contains codes that I have used for my Master's Thesis at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (2012-2014). 

My work is related to a field in Robotics called **Imitation Learning**.

You will get a good idea about this field if you read **Robot Programming by Demonstration** by Aude Billard, Sylvian Calinon, Rudiger Dillimann, Stefan Schaal.

Both myself and [Ankit Pensia](https://github.com/ankitp94) (under-grad at IIT Kanpur and my super-intelligent mentee for the summers 2014) have contributed in the development of these codes.
